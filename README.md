## Bio:
I'm an avid coder, consumer of Gushers, and love FIRST Robotics. I am a mentor for younger children participating in FIRST Lego League and compete in the high school FIRST Robotics Competition with my team, [FRC Team 834](https://github.com/FRCTeam834). I also work on mechanics and 3D printers in my spare time. I enjoy working on pet projects, such as my 3D printer, spending time with family and friends, and working on robotics.
